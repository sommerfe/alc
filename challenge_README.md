# Challenge 1

Please organize, design, test, and deploy your code (locally on your machine is fine) as if it were going into production. Then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

## Challenge Description

_The Team has identified the need to create and organize new requests for procurement. If users want to buy a product or service they need to create a formal request to the procurement department. That will afterwards process this request_

### 1. Intake

The initial step in submitting a procurement request is the intake process. This phase is crucial as it gathers all necessary details for the procurement department to proceed. Below is a table of the required information:

| Field Name                                  | Description                                                     | Example                           |

|                                             | - Amount: The quantity or number of units being ordered.        | 5                                 |
|                                             | - Unit: The unit of measure or quantity (e.g., licenses).       | licenses                          |

In the first step build the functionality to create and submit new requests.

Feedback from user interviews has highlighted that requestors often have a vendor's offer at hand. To streamline the process, your task is to introduce an automatic extraction feature, allowing users to upload a document, which then auto-fills the request.

Additionally, choosing the correct commodity group has been a challenge for users due to its complexity. A procurement manager of the customer says to you: "I don't want that the users have to select the commodity group, they always pick the wrong one, isn't there a better solution?"

**Key Points:**

- Ensure every request is saved for future reference.
- Aim to simplify the request submission process for users.
- Ensure that only valid requests can be submitted.

### 2. Request Overview

With the capability to submit requests, the procurement department requires a system to view and manage these submissions. It's critical to track and update the status of each request (Open, In Progress, Closed) to maintain transparency within the department.

**Key Points:**

- Implement a system to retain every status update accurately.

## Requirements

- Build a program with an web-based front-end to fulfill the above requirenments of the customer
- Choose the tech stack of your choice
- It should be a usuable product
- Deployment on your local machine is fine

## Some Final Remarks

- We actively encourage our employees to use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot ðŸ˜‰
- Also feel free to use libraries like (LangChain, etc.) that allow you to build faster.
- We will provide you an OpenAI api key
- There are many ways to convince us, but most important is that the key parts are working. Evaluation will also be subject to your background (e.g. if you are no front-end developer, a misplaced button is totally fine, as long as the product is usable)
